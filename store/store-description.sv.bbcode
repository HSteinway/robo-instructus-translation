Robo Instructus is a puzzle game in which players manoeuvre a robot by issuing instructions via a simple programming language.

As players progress through the game they unlock new functions to overcome new puzzles, each of which can be solved in multiple ways. The more you master the robot, the more elegant and powerful your solutions will be.

Take the role of a Salvage Engineer sent across space. Use wits and tenacity to uncover the secrets of this isolated, frozen world.
